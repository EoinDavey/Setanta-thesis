# Setanta: Thesis

I created Setanta as part of my final year project at Maynooth University, for my BSc. Computational Thinking. This repo contains my thesis and original design notes.

_Site note: This repo was cloned from the Setanta-site repo, it's not the original repo. I separated the two as the Setanta project grew beyond the original scope of the thesis._
