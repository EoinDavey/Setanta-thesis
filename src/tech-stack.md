# Technology stack outline

Here I am going to outline the various technologies that I intend to use for this project

## Front-End.

For the front-end of this project I intend to use the following web technologies

### Polymer: [*https://www.polymer-project.org*](https://www.polymer-project.org).

The polymer project is a platform for developing web components and building web apps using web components. I have some experience using Polymer as I used this to develop a dashboard during my time in Google ZÃ¼rich. I will be using Polymer version 3.0

### TypeScript.

To avoid the dynamic typing of JavaScript I will be using TypeScript. TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of ES6 JavaScript. TypeScript transpiles to JavaScript. Polymer does not directly support TypeScript so this will be an interesting exercise to get the two to behave together.

### CodeMirror: [*https://codemirror.net*](https://codemirror.net).

CodeMirror is a library for developing text editors in the browser. My team at HackMIT used this to develop the editor for our Muse language ([*https://github.com/EoinDavey/Muse*](https://github.com/EoinDavey/Muse)). This is a powerful library that will make writing the text editor easy.

## Back-End.

The back end will likely be built on the following technologies

### Go.

This project will use the Go language for all back-end development.

### Docker.

The project will utilise the modern approach of containerisation, to package the project for easy deployment on servers and cloud services

### Kubernetes (possibly).

Kubernetes (k8s) could be used to deploy the web app in the most scalable way, using automatic scaling and load distribution.
