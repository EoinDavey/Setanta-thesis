\chapter{Introduction}
For easier distinction between programming languages and "human" languages, from this point I will refer to programming languages as \textbf{PLs}, and traditional languages as just \textbf{languages}.
\section{Motivation}
English is the language of choice for the programming world, even PLs developed in non English speaking countries are designed to be written in English, e.g. \emph{Lua} (developed in the Netherlands), \emph{Ruby} (developed in Japan). This focus on one single language must have some impact the way we design our PLs. Many PLs have been written for other languages, but if you go to use one you will almost certainly find that it is a \emph{translation} of a PL originally written for English speakers\cite{wikipllist}. If we design a PL from the ground up around a non English language, what changes do we see between it and the industry standard English PLs.

Irish was chosen as the language to build the new PL around for many reasons, the obvious being that it is the native language of Ireland, so it is of interest to an Irish audience, but this is not the only reason. Ireland is a language that historically has faced significant hostility, and today finds itself a minority language in its own country, however it is still spoken by over 73,000 people daily\cite{csoirish}. If any Irish speaking person wishes to learn about programming, they have no choice but to do it through the medium of English. By creating an Irish PL and an online learning environment around it I hope to enable people to learn to program in they way that they want to.

\section{Problem Statement}
This project involves the design and implementation of a new, modern, innovative PL, named \Setanta{}. \Setanta{} is to be developed entirely in Irish. It will not be a translation or a modification of a previously existing PL, this is to allow the PL design to be influenced by the Irish language at every stage.

\Setanta{} will be designed with education in mind. It will be built to run in the browser, in order to enable high ease of access to as many people as possible. By running the code in the browser, no installations are required to use the PL, just a web browser.

\Setanta{} must be a modern PL with all industry standard features, this is to ensure that by learning it, you learn the most fundamental programming concepts. Additionally it should be built to overcome the limitations of the browser environment. Executing code in the browser limits you to a single thread and no blocking operations, by building a language on top of this we can abstract out these limitations and enable users to use concurrent functions and blocking operations such as IO.

An online learning environment will be created where the user can write and \Setanta{} in the browser. It should be accessible and easy to use. To assist in the learning process the environment will take inspiration from popular educational tools like \emph{Scratch} and \emph{Logo} and have a graphical interface where the user can draw shapes and interact with visual elements. Research has shown that the use of visual elements in educational approaches improves the learning experience\cite{graphiclearning}.

To implement an interpreter for a PL a parser is needed, usually a parser generator is used to do this. However, as not many languages are built to be browser-first, the parser generator choices available for TypeScript (my PL of choice for this project) were not quite suitable. This leads to the additional part of this project to create a novel parser generator for TypeScript. The parser generator must be powerful enough to support \Setanta{}, as well as to be capable of bootstrapping its own parser. It should be built on the latest innovations in parsing technology, providing accurate syntax error detection and ASTs to the user. The ASTs generated by the parser should be strongly typed, to enable maximum utility of the TypeScript type system.

\section{Approach}
The approach to completing involves a few main steps. First a prototype of the learning environment is made as an experimentation sandbox and proof of concept. JavaScript will be initially used as a stand in for \Setanta{} as it can be already executed on the browser. Using JavaScript and the environment prototype we explore options for abstracting out the single threading and non-blocking operations restrictions described above. We also experiment with different options for creating a graphical display that the user can manipulate and draw on.

After experimenting with the sandbox we move to the design process of \Setanta{}. We must decide on several important features of the language, in terms of syntax and semantics. The design process will involve creating several documents outlining the decision process in real time. The linguistic properties of Irish will be contrasted with those of English and used to influence the syntax and semantics of the language.

After a design is settled on we move to creating the parser generator \tsPEG{}. This is a key component and will be needed to create the parser for \Setanta{}. \tsPEG{} is worked on as a largely independent project, in fact my supervisor has stated that he thinks that \tsPEG{} is of sufficient independent interest to be a final year project of it's own. The creation process for \tsPEG{} involves reading up on existing state of the art parser generators and techniques, and then creating a new generator with those ideas in mind, as well as the requirements of \Setanta{}. \tsPEG{} is created by using a bootstrapping process whereby a simple parser is made by hand for a very basic grammar, then this is used to self bootstrap further and further powerful features until we have created an expressive, state of the art parser generator.

\tsPEG{} is then used to create the parser for \Setanta{}, and work on implementing \Setanta{} can begin. Like \tsPEG{}, \Setanta{} is created by first implementing the basic features of a PL, variables, loops, function calls. We then move on to implementing more and more complex features including classes, inheritance, closures, first order functions and concurrency support. As we create \Setanta{} we replace the JavaScript in the learning environment with \Setanta{}, thus creating the full end-to-end product.

After creation of \Setanta{} we return to the learning environment, adding a backend that allows users to save their code and send it to others. We improve the visual look of the website, and improve the concurrency abstractions as we prepare it for release.

\section{Metrics}

The main strategy to evaluate this project is by evaluating the degree of completion of the main goals. We will evaluate how successful the project was by examining the level of success that was attained in completing the goals. The goals for \Setanta{} include creating a new, modern programming language in Irish, evaluating how it differs from languages designed in English, how beginner friendly it is, and how much interest there is in the language from the community at large.

For \tsPEG{} the goals are to create a powerful parser generator for TypeScript. \tsPEG{} should be powerful enough to build a real programming language with, it should be capable of self-hosting it's own input parser. \tsPEG{} should be based on novel ideas in parser technology, and be highly configurable to different projects. \tsPEG{} aims to have powerful syntax error reporting and recovery, and to be highly strongly typed. We would also like \tsPEG{} to be of interest to the parser community, hopefully finding use in other projects.

The learning environment has many goals. It must be an accessible website where users can write and execute \Setanta{} code. The website should allow users to experiment with \Setanta{}, both through classical text IO programming, and by allowing them access to an API to draw and manipulate shapes and objects on a graphics display. It should be a beginner friendly website so that it draws the interest of people who have not yet learned to program.
