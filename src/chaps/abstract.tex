\chapter{Abstract}
The English language dominates the world of programming languages, it is well established as the lingua franca of the programming world.
Effectively all programming languages that are used today are designed to be used in English.
Studies have shown that language affects the thoughts of the speaker, so how does it affect how we design our programming languages?
This project is an exploration of the design and implementation of a programming language (\Setanta{}) from the ground up, to be written in a non-English language, namely Irish, and the effects that the ``host'' language has on its syntax and semantics.
In recent times Irish is often thought of as an academic, historical language, however, Irish is a language used by 73,000 people daily. There is a large contingent of fluent Irish speakers who, if they want to learn how to program, have no choice but to learn in English.
In this project, we create \Setanta{}, a modern, powerful Irish programming language.
In the process of designing \Setanta{}, we discover syntactic constructs in traditional programming languages that are tied to English and introduce new features that are motivated by the Irish language.
We develop and launch an online learning platform (\href{https://try-setanta.ie}{try-setanta.ie}).
When implementing an interpreter for \Setanta{}, we find and fill gaps in the tooling available for creating a programming language to be executed in the browser.
Specifically by creating an innovative parser generator (\tsPEG{}) for the language TypeScript.
