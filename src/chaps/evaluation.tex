\section{\tsPEG{}}

The \tsPEG{} parser generator was implemented almost precisely to the original design. The correctness and effectiveness of \tsPEG{} can be seen in a few ways.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \tsPEG{} is self-hosting, meaning that the input parser for \tsPEG{} is generated by \tsPEG{} itself. This would not be possible if \tsPEG{}s parsers were not correct. The input grammar makes use of all the main features of \tsPEG{}, so this acts as a rigorous self-referential test, whereby the whole project fails to even compile if it is not correct.
    \item The correctness of \tsPEG{} is also guaranteed by a suite of unit tests and end to end tests.
    \item \tsPEG{} generates the parser for the \Setanta{} interpreter. This proves that \tsPEG{} is capable of generating parsers for fully-featured programming languages, with complex and intricate grammars. The use of \tsPEG{} in the \Setanta{} build process serves as a full stress test of all the features available to it.
\end{itemize}

\tsPEG{} has attracted attention from the TypeScript community, showing that it serves a useful purpose as a tool for the community. \tsPEG{} has over 30 stars on Github and hit a peak of over 250 downloads in one week after it's initial release. \tsPEG{} has found use in projects outside of \Setanta{}, In fact on the submission deadline day (13th April) I received an email from someone thanking me for creating \tsPEG{} and telling me they have put it to use to solve a complex problem. However, \tsPEG{} still has many features that it would benefit hugely from, the main ones being improving the syntax error reporting capabilities and efficiency.

\section{\Setanta{}}

As outlined in the solution section of \Setanta{} (\ref{setantasolution}), the implementation of \Setanta{} was a success, it meets every goal that was set out originally for it. \Setanta{} is a modern, novel, innovative language, that runs in the browser and is built from the bottom up in Irish. Lot's of programs have been written in \Setanta{}, some by me, some by others.

The correctness of \Setanta{} is ensured by a large suite of tests, including unit tests, and full end to end tests. \Setanta{} contains over 1300 lines of test code alone. These tests ensure that every edge of language behaviour is correct, theses tests are run automatically by the continuous integration system with each commit. The current state of \Setanta{}'s builds can be seen at \href{https://travis-ci.com/EoinDavey/Setanta}{travis-ci.com/EoinDavey/Setanta.}

\Setanta{}'s main issue is its speed. As it is built on top of the JavaScript environment but requires blocking operations and concurrency, it means that \Setanta{} has taken on an extremely large overhead. The result of this is that \Setanta{} is notably slow at some tasks. However, the domain of \Setanta{} is education, not high performance or production computing, so this is not a direct detractor from the quality of the project. I have taken several steps to keep the efficiency of \Setanta{} at a high enough level that it's not noticeably slow.
These steps are outlined in sections \ref{solution:treecompression} and \ref{solution:asyncawaitslowness}.

The fact that the same \Setanta{} interpreter can be used both in the browser and in a local CLI shows the code is well abstracted and isolated, the main \lstinline|Interpreter| class is very portable and can be loaded in a wide variety of environments.

\Setanta{} has received a notable amount of attention online. Before I had even announced the project I had received requests to use the project from people who had stumbled upon the repository. I gave a talk on \Setanta{} at SISTEM 2020 (A tech conference held in UCD) and it received high praise from many of the attendees.

\section{\trys{}}

The \trys{} learning environment has also been largely successful and meets most of the original design goals for it. \trys{} is a simple to use website where the user can write and execute \Setanta{} code, it has a good editor with syntax highlighting and a powerful graphics API.
The implementation of \trys{} is quite modern, taking advantage of the latest features of HTML5 and CSS3. \trys{} is built on the web components technology, this means that the main components of the \trys{} website are fully isolated, abstracted and re-usable.

\trys{} doesn't meet the original design plan of having an extremely high-level graphics API. Instead, there is a lower-level graphics API. This decision was made as I found in the development process of this API that it was easier to understand a simple API that let you call a function to draw circles, squares etc. than a very high-level API where you would need to use classes and inheritance and other features to interact with the API.

\section{Overall project}

Overall I think this project has been a resounding success, especially for a project that is worth just 5 credits. The project works seamlessly from end to end, covering a wide range of technical skills, including compiler design, language design, back-end servers \& databases, front end web-development, technical documentation writing, UI/UX design, cloud infrastructure/deployment, testing, build systems, bootstrapping, etc. Each part of this project presented its own set of interesting problems to be solved, and each part comes together to create a complete final package. The project as a whole now contains over 15k lines of code, and between the 3 main components racked up over 450 commits.
