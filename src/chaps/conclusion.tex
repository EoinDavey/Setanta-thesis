\section{Goals and project reception}
The main goals for the project were to create an original Irish programming language, a learning environment, and a parser generator for TypeScript. In reference to these goals, the project has been successful. All of the components of the project have been completed and released to the world.

At the time of writing \trys{} has been visited over 400 times, and the \Setanta{} REPL has been downloaded over 100 times, these parts of the project haven't even been properly announced yet, only to people I directly have spoken to.

\tsPEG{} has been downloaded well over 700 times, and has been maintaining an average of over 20 downloads a week.

\section{The value of non-English PLs}

In creating \Setanta{}, we intended for the design process to expose some links between standard PLs and English. As discussed in the section on the @ operator (\ref{atoperator}), even simple, extremely common features such as the dot (.) operator have subtle ties to the English language. Although the links we found were not groundbreaking by any means, the existence of these links is important. Diversity of thought is hampered when all programming is passed through the lens of the English language, and in this project we've seen that it's not just the keywords that form this lens, but the deeper design of the PL too.

\Setanta{} wasn't created with the goal of being a huge technical breakthrough, in fact, as an educational language, we were aiming for familiarity.
\Setanta{} was created to break the pattern of English PLs, and reveal the limitations that had been placed upon us by them.

While I was working on this project, a student in Carnegie Mellon had a similar idea, and created the worlds first classical Chinese PL\cite{chinesepl}. This shows that there is a general interest in non-English PLs in the world.

\section{The future of the project}

This project has been a passion project for me, and I fully intend to continue it's development. I plan on a full release of version 1.0 of \Setanta{} soon, after I complete a full documentation and tutorial for it.
I hope that \Setanta{} finds use in CS education, there are many schools and institutions around the country that I hope will have some interest in it. I have met many people who have shown great enthusiasm for the project, I plan on opening the project up to the open source community, hopefully including someone with much better Irish than me.
